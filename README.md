### **Problem Statement Title**  
**Development of AI-ML Based Map-Matching Algorithm for GNSS-based Tolling**

---

### **Description**  
This project focuses on developing a robust map-matching algorithm using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to distinguish vehicular movement on highways and service roads. The solution aims to function even when GNSS data is intermittent or contains large biases. The algorithm is intended to support GNSS-based tolling applications, helping to enhance the efficiency of toll collection and traffic management.

Key objectives:
1. Distinguish vehicle movement on highways vs service roads using coarse GNSS data.
2. Utilize AI-ML techniques to improve map-matching performance, even with suboptimal GNSS signals.
3. Apply the algorithm to tolling systems to streamline operations and reduce errors.
