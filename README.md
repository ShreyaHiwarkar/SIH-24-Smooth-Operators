### **Problem Statement:**  
**Development of map-matching algorithm using AI-ML techniques to distinguish vehicular movement on highway and service road**

### **Description**  
This project focuses on developing a robust map-matching algorithm using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to distinguish vehicular movement on highways and service roads. The solution aims to function even when GNSS data is intermittent or contains large biases. The algorithm is intended to support GNSS-based tolling applications, helping to enhance the efficiency of toll collection and traffic management.

Key objectives:
1. Distinguish vehicle movement on highways vs service roads using coarse GNSS data.
2. Utilize AI-ML techniques to improve map-matching performance, even with suboptimal GNSS signals.
3. Apply the algorithm to tolling systems to streamline operations and reduce errors.

### **Proposed Solution**
To solve the challenge of distinguishing whether a vehicle is on the highway or service road using intermittent or biased GNSS data, weâ€™ve developed a systematic approach that combines map-matching algorithms and AI-ML techniques to deliver accurate results.

**Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing**
We start by collecting GNSS data from vehicles, which includes latitude, longitude, speed, and heading. Since GNSS data can sometimes be noisy or incomplete due to signal loss, we clean and preprocess it. This step ensures the data is standardized and any missing values are handled effectively, preparing it for the next stages.

**Step 2: Map-Matching Algorithm**
Next, we implement a map-matching algorithm to plot the vehicleâ€™s movement accurately on a map. Here's how it works:

The algorithm takes the raw GNSS data and snaps the coordinates to the nearest road segment on the map.
We use additional factors like vehicle speed, heading, and proximity to known highways or service roads to further refine the matching accuracy.
This ensures that even if the GNSS position is slightly off, our system can still correctly identify which road segment (highway or service road) the vehicle is traveling on.

**Step 3: AI-ML Techniques for Classification**
We then apply machine learning models to make the map-matching smarter. Weâ€™ve trained these models on real-world vehicle trajectories, so they can accurately predict whether a vehicle is on the highway or the service road based on the patterns in the data.

The models consider vehicle movement patterns, the structure of the road network, and the behavior of GNSS signals in different environments.
This allows us to handle cases where the GNSS data is unreliable or missing by accurately predicting the vehicleâ€™s position based on historical data.

**Step 4: Handling GNSS Gaps or Biases**
When GNSS data is missing or severely biased, our system uses the following approach:

We analyze the last known position of the vehicle and combine it with the vehicle's average speed and heading to estimate where it is likely to be.
We factor in the road layout and possible routes the vehicle might take, based on its current trajectory, ensuring that the estimate remains accurate even in the absence of live GNSS data.

**Step 5: Integration with GNSS-Based Tolling Systems**
Finally, we integrate this solution into the GNSS-based tolling system. The map-matching and AI-ML algorithms provide precise data on whether a vehicle used the highway or service road, ensuring correct tolls are applied. This makes the tolling system more reliable and fair for users.
