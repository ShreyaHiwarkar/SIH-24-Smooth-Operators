# SIH-24-Smooth-Operators
Goal is to create a precise map-matching algorithm using AI-ML techniques to differentiate between highway and service road movements, even with unreliable GNSS data. Tasks include data collection, feature engineering, algorithm development, and rigorous testing. Also enhancing GNSS-based tolling and navigation with accurate vehicle classification.
